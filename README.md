This project was initially generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3 and developed by Mc SPraint A.K.A Snahashis Das.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deployment Server

Run `ng build --watch` or `ng build` and then run `node server`.
Your application is now deployed in a node server(server.js).
if you experience loss of responsiveness in layout after deployment mode, you should
go to the head section of the index.html file in dist/ folder where you will find "min-width:992px !important" then
change it to "min-width: 134px !important".

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component, You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `www/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
